         <p class="card-text">For the color scheme of the choropleth map, I just chose a simple “blues-purples” color
scheme, even though I don’t really see any purple in there. I thought that this light to darker color
scheme would make for easy interpretation of the net flow of bananas for each country, given that
it’s just a scale from net loss to net gain. I made the nodes all black for easy visibility and made it so
there were only a few different sizes so that they would be easily distinguishable from one another.
For the flow symbology, I also used a simple light to dark color gradient with not that many classes
so it would be easy to distinguish which flow arrows belonged to which class. I reduced the number
of flow arrows shown because there were a ton of tiny flow arrows that crossed through nodes and
made the map confusing to interpret.

In general, the Western areas in South America seem to receive the most flows. Even further, the
South is comprised of uninterrupted areas receiving the highest level of banana flows. The flows
seem to primarily flow from North to South, which is probably due to regions in the North closer to
the tropical zone/equator being more climatically conducive to banana farming. Since the variables
are all related (net imports/exports of bananas, amount of bananas being transported, and the total
flow of bananas), the arrows, nodes, and choropleth maps all work collectively and affirm the
patterns shown by each individual part. Ecuador is by far the biggest exporter of bananas, whereas
Chile and Argentina are the biggest importers of bananas in the continent overall, but the biggest
fluxes on the map are also from Ecuador to Chile and Argentina
